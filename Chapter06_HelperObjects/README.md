# Speak Line With Helpers

Same excersice from chapter 5, but adding delegates and helper objects

# Challenge 1: resize window

App with one window. By using a delegate, when the window is resized the height should be twice as wide.

# Challenge 2: ToDo list

A TableView, and a button and a text field. The user writes on the text field, clicks on add and we should see the item added to the TableView
